# change management in dataset
1. We have two datasets -
1a. data__2019-11-28.csv which is a set of data (one data in one row) for November 28, 2019. We will call this set V1
1b. data__2019-11-29.csv which is another set of data (one data in one row) for November 29, 2019. We will call this set V2
2. There are changes between V1 and V2. It is like that V2 is an incremental update on V1
3. We need to generate a V3 where V1 is updated with the changes in V2
4. The idea is to find out what will be the fastest way to do this and then code it

# data visualization
1. We have a dataset in Google sheet - HR&Admin__2020-01__attendance-log. This is log from office entry/exit door device- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YsTJcb83ZgCyNYFUye38xkvRm4LcxRmY_W1VHPSgTOc/edit#gid=1177265077
2. Figure out a way to read the data and use it for subsequent visualization
3. What could be the best visualization possible from this set of data if anyone wants to use this data from a user's viewpoint
4. The idea is to identify and generate all the questions/requirement that could be asked from this dataset. At least twenty (20) different requirements.
5. Then develop the visualization system (if time permits)

# data acquisition, validation and aggregation - conveyance bills
1. Each month employees share individual Google sheet with HR. The sheet is the employee's conveyance and other expense sheet for that month
2. Find ways to create a new Google sheet for HR which will be used as an index to list and locate all the Google sheets that were shared by employees for the month
3. .... this assignment will be expanded as you progress ....
