\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
A document to get you started. Delete any text you do not want.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Click directly into the text if you want to place the cursor. For technical reasons the cursor cannot be positioned if you click far away from text.  To start a new paragraph, you have to press the enter key twice.

\subsection{Commands}

For headers or other \textbf{special} formatting then you need a  \LaTeX\ command. These commands must be entered in the footer window. Best is to copy/paste such formatting from examples that you can find on many forum websites in the internet. There are also plenty of reasonable  \LaTeX\ tutorials around.
